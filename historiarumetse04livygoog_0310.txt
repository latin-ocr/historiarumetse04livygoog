Livy has more puzzled commentators than this. ome regard n ascorrttpt,
tigough ancient copies, both manuscript and printed, agree in tlte reading
a ove iven.

Oi those who consider the text as seond, some think densa ls used ad·
verbially sor dense (as in viruit, Georgics, it. 275. Denstl sere), andlqualifies
obsita: some make densa and obsita both agree with virgulta, and interpret
obedo by adsita, aal'acerrtia: and some wrrte oh sita as two words, esther
placin a comma ader circi, thns locis tired, derna ob sita oirgsdtu obscuris,
or, without a eornma, construing as ii, ob circis depossita virgulta. 'ro those

ol tlte above modes in which obsita is written as one word, it is objected,
that, in its usual sense of ‘ set thick with,’ ‘overgrown or covered with ¹ it
always agrees witlr the thing covered, and not wnh that which eovers3 thus
· toea obsito tirgttitit is a proper expression, bttt net so virgulta obedo lecit:
while the inter retation oi obsita by afferentia is not warranted by a single
exam le. lt llas also been objected that the construction, which occurs in
tlte a ve modes, of two adjectives before otte substantive, is harsh aad
unusual 3 bnt examples sufficient to ‘ustily titis are found in Livy, as well aa
other authors, e. g. caralis regie sella, speciosas rrtrr'nnn dics, eto.

These who think the text corrn t are no less at variante with each other
as to the manner es restoring it. ne reading proposed is locis circd denso
obsito oirgsrlto oscines, another, riensi obsito tergono, (both of which are open
to the objection mentioned above, of opptytnr obsito ιο tlte wrong obgeet);
another, partem militant locis circii denso olrsitrs isti-„notro obscuram. Α omth
refertos the passage by leaving out obsito, as a gloss (ot explanatory word)
in tlte margin ol the manuscript, which try accident carne into tlte text3 while
aliilh, and tlte happiest emendation os all, is by Heinsius, locis circel denso
obsitis trirgttltolac obscuris.

This note, which is chiefly a mere abstract os tlte accumulated annotatione
on the passage in Drakenborch’s edition oi Livy (omitting a lon array oi
citatione and ‘the names of a multitude of critiesl, is here placed iore tlte

raltenhorch mentions the o inion ei a learned friend ot* ins, that tlte
common reading may ba defended, and the whole difficulty done awap, by

considering virgiaco as a semmine noun oi the first deciension in tlte ab stiva
