tlte boolr will be found to possess a good degree of unity ; Α
vfew events being mentioned as if within the reader's knowl-
edge, of which an account has not been given in some pre·
ceding extract.

The text of Drakenborch has been adopted, as, on the
¹ whole, of the highest authority3 but, Livy being the author
first read incur Colleges, care has been taken to conform the
orthography of those words which may be variously written,
tc the Dictionaries and Grammars in common use. Witha
similar regard to the condition of newly formed classes,
necessarily consisting of individuals of different degrees of
proficiency‚ certain ambiguous words are distinguished by
accents; but students should become accustomed to dispenso,
with these facilities in some part of their course, for modern
editions of the classics rarely afford then*

The notes, which are chiefly derived from the editions of
Miiller, Doering, and Ruperti, fill as much space as could well
be allowed to thern in this edition,xsince it was thought best
not to exceed the size cs the volume for which this is pro·

„ posed as a substitute. In quantity, however, that volume is
considerably exceeded by the present. The notes are devoted

principally to the First Roolr, because more real difficulties
occur here, and because¹ the student must be supposed to
need fewer explanations as he advanccs, from having become

s ln employing accentual marks. Ruddiman's rules are followed. ‘⁴ ln·
declinabis words of the saure forrn with words declinable, and preposi-
tions used without a case, as adverbs, have a grave occant on the last
syllable ;'' and, agreeably to Ruddirnan also, this secent is not changed
to an acute when an enclitic follows, since the purpose for which the
marli is here used has no connexion with tlre sound. When. however,
the declinable word is such as is found very rurely, and the indeclinablc
word of the same spelling is of verv frequent occurrence, tlre accent is
omitted, e. g. su‘ls, mrrgfs, sepe. “ Contracted syllables are rnarlred with
a circumflari, also the final syllable of tlre ablative of the first declen·
sion.'' and this (contrary to Ruddimau) even when the governing prepo-
sitiou is expressed.
